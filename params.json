Visual History maps your walk on the internet graph.","body":"# Visual History\r\n\r\nModern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forrest of links surprisingly difficult. Visual History augments browser navigation in a way that is both quick, reliable, and predictable for power users, and also beautiful and intuitive for beginners.\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/0.png)\r\n\r\nVisual History is a Chrome extension that delinearizes your browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, Visual History maintains the forest of trees that represent each tabâ€™s path around the internet, and lets the user easily backtrack to any site they recently visited. \r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/1.png)\r\n\r\n[This solves an ancient problem with Wikipedia](https://xkcd.com/214/)\r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/3.png)\r\n\r\nRoutes that normally have to be manually re-traced by users, like jumping between search results or forum posts, can now be intuitively and quickly directed without revisiting the parent page. \r\n\r\n![](/screenshots/2.png)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nNavigate around the graph by clicking the graph icon in the toolbar, or by using Ctrl + arrow key shortcuts. Whatever node is selected when Ctrl is released will be navigated to.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n - [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)\r\n - [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
